Result:
The program successfully displayed various graphical elements on the screen, including pixels, lines, a rectangle, a circle, and text. Each element was drawn with different colors and positions, demonstrating the basic capabilities of C graphics and the use of the graphics.h library. The background color and text were also successfully set, confirming that the program correctly executes basic drawing commands.

Conclusion:
Computer graphics allows us to visually represent data and ideas on a screen, making it easier to understand and interact with information. Using C and the graphics.h library, we can create basic shapes, lines, pixels, and text, which form the foundation for more advanced graphical applications. This exercise demonstrates how simple programming commands can control graphics output, helping beginners understand the relationship between code and visual representation.
